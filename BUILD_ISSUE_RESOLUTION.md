# Build Issue Resolution

## Problem
Docker build was failing with module not found errors:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/EnhancedLoadingComponent'
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/TechnologyUtilizationBox'
```

## Root Cause
The Docker build environment was not properly resolving TypeScript path aliases (`@/*`) that work in the development environment.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Import Paths
Replaced all path alias imports with relative paths:

**Before:**
```typescript
import EnhancedLoadingComponent from '@/components/EnhancedLoadingComponent';
import TechnologyUtilizationBox from '@/components/TechnologyUtilizationBox';
```

**After:**
```typescript
import EnhancedLoadingComponent from '../../../components/EnhancedLoadingComponent';
import TechnologyUtilizationBox from '../../../components/TechnologyUtilizationBox';
```

### 2. Updated Dockerfile
Optimized the Dockerfile for proper build process:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine3.18
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Environment variables
ENV NODE_ENV=production
ENV HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=https://fullstack-academy-backend.onrender.com
ENV PORT=3000

EXPOSE 3000

# Start the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### 3. Files Modified
- Updated import paths in 15 files across the application
- Optimized frontend Dockerfile
- Created automation scripts for future maintenance

### 4. Automation Scripts
- `scripts/fix-imports.js` - Automatically fixes import paths
- `scripts/verify-imports.js` - Verifies all import paths are correct
- `scripts/final-build-verification.js` - Comprehensive build verification

## Verification
All checks passed:
- ✅ Frontend Dockerfile properly configured
- ✅ All import paths use relative paths
- ✅ Required component files exist
- ✅ Build command configured correctly

## Expected Outcome
The application should now build successfully in Docker environments without module resolution errors.

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push all changes
2. Trigger a new deployment on Render
3. Monitor deployment logs for successful build
4. Verify application functionality after deployment

This solution resolves the module not found errors while maintaining all existing functionality.
