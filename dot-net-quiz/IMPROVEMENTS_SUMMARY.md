# Fullstack Academy Improvements Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes and improvements made to the Fullstack Academy application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Laravel Quiz Module Submission Issue
**Problem**: The Laravel interview quiz module wasn't properly submitting answers.
**Root Cause**: The module was using a different approach than other quiz modules, causing inconsistencies in how GraphQL mutations were handled.
**Solution**: 
- Updated the Laravel interview quiz to use the same Apollo client setup as other modules
- Implemented proper error handling and loading states
- Added consistent UI elements and styling
- Integrated with the backend submitLaravelAnswer mutation

### 2. Theme Switching Issue
**Problem**: The dark/light mode toggle wasn't working properly.
**Root Cause**: CSS classes weren't being applied correctly, and there were conflicts in the global CSS.
**Solution**:
- Updated the global CSS to properly handle dark mode class toggling
- Added specific dark mode styles for code elements
- Ensured the DarkModeContext was properly applying theme classes to the document

### 3. Layout Consistency Issue
**Problem**: The header and main content weren't the same width, and the footer was being pushed out of the viewport.
**Root Cause**: Inconsistent container widths and missing flexbox properties.
**Solution**:
- Updated the layout.tsx file to ensure consistent max-width and padding
- Added proper flexbox properties to keep footer in correct position
- Made header and main content use the same container constraints
