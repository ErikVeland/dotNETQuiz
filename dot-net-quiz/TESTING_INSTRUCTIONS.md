## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Backend server fails to start (port in use)
**Solution**:
```bash
lsof -ti:5022 | xargs kill -9
cd /Users/veland/dotNetQuiz/dot-net-quiz/backend
dotnet run
```

#### Issue: Frontend server fails to start (port in use)
**Solution**:
```bash
lsof -ti:3000,3001 | xargs kill -9
cd /Users/veland/dotNetQuiz/dot-net-quiz/frontend
npm run dev
```

#### Issue: Theme switching not working
**Solution**:
1. Clear browser localStorage
2. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

#### Issue: Laravel content not loading
**Solution**:
1. Verify backend server is running
2. Check GraphQL endpoint at http://localhost:5022/graphql
3. Test queries in GraphQL Playground
4. Check browser console for network errors

## Success Criteria

All tests should pass with the following criteria:
1. Layout consistency maintained across all pages and screen sizes
2. Theme switching works reliably and persists across sessions
3. Laravel quiz module functions identically to other quiz modules
4. All GraphQL queries and mutations work correctly
5. User experience is consistent across all technology tracks
6. No JavaScript errors in the browser console
7. Reasonable page load times (< 3 seconds for initial load)
8. Proper error handling for edge cases
