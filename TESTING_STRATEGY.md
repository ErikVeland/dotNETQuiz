# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing approach for each module in the Fullstack Academy platform.

## React Module

### Unit Tests
- Test React components with Jest and React Testing Library
- Mock API calls to backend services
- Test component rendering and user interactions

### Integration Tests
- Test API endpoints with backend services
- Test data flow between components

### UI Tests
- End-to-end tests with Cypress
- Test critical user flows like navigation and quiz submission

### Accessibility Tests
- Use axe-core to test WCAG compliance
- Test keyboard navigation

## Laravel Module

### Unit Tests
- Test Laravel models, controllers, and services with PHPUnit
- Test business logic and data validation

### Feature Tests
- Test HTTP endpoints and responses
- Test database interactions

### Browser Tests
- Use Laravel Dusk for end-to-end testing
- Test user authentication and form submissions

## Node.js Module

### Unit Tests
- Test Express routes and middleware with Jest
- Test business logic functions

### Integration Tests
- Test API endpoints with supertest
- Test database operations

### End-to-End Tests
- Test with Puppeteer or Playwright
- Test static file serving and API interactions

## Tailwind CSS Module

### Visual Regression Tests
- Use Percy or Chromatic for visual testing
- Test responsive design across breakpoints

### Unit Tests
- Test utility class generation
- Test custom configuration

## SASS Module

### Compilation Tests
- Test SASS to CSS compilation
- Test output CSS validity

### Visual Tests
- Compare compiled output with expected results
- Test responsive behavior

## Shared Testing Infrastructure

### Test Data
- Use consistent test data across modules
- Maintain separate test databases

### CI/CD Integration
- Run tests on every commit
- Generate test coverage reports
- Block deployments on test failures

### Performance Testing
- Test page load times
- Test API response times
- Test under load with Artillery or k6

### Security Testing
- Test for common vulnerabilities
- Validate input sanitization
- Test authentication and authorization
