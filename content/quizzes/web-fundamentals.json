      "question": "Which HTML5 element should be used to wrap the main navigation links of a website?",
      "topic": "HTML5",
      "difficulty": "Beginner",
      "choices": [
        "<nav>",
        "<div>",
        "<header>",
        "<menu>"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The <nav> element is specifically designed for navigation links. It provides semantic meaning that helps screen readers and search engines understand the purpose of the content. Using <div> provides no semantic value, while <header> is for page headers and <menu> is for interactive commands.",
      "industryContext": "Semantic HTML improves website accessibility for users with disabilities and helps search engines better understand and rank your content.",

      "question": "What is the correct CSS to center a div horizontally and vertically using Flexbox?",
      "topic": "CSS3",
      "difficulty": "Intermediate",
      "choices": [
        "display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;",
        "display: flex; align-content: center; justify-items: center;",
        "display: block; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;",
        "display: grid; place-items: center;"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "With Flexbox, 'justify-content: center' centers items horizontally (main axis) and 'align-items: center' centers them vertically (cross axis). Option D would work with CSS Grid, but the question specifically asks about Flexbox.",
      "industryContext": "Flexbox is the most common method for centering content in modern web development, replacing older techniques like floats and positioning.",

      "question": "Which JavaScript method is used to select an element by its ID?",
      "topic": "JavaScript",
      "difficulty": "Beginner",
      "choices": [
        "document.getElementById('myId')",
        "document.querySelector('#myId')",
        "document.getElementByClass('myId')",
        "Both A and B are correct"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Both document.getElementById('myId') and document.querySelector('#myId') can select an element by ID. getElementById is the traditional method, while querySelector is more flexible and can use any CSS selector. Option C is incorrect because it should be getElementsByClassName and it's for classes, not IDs.",
      "industryContext": "DOM manipulation is fundamental to interactive web development. Understanding different selection methods helps you choose the most efficient approach for your needs.",

      "question": "What does this CSS media query do?\n\n@media (max-width: 768px) { /* styles */ }",
      "topic": "CSS3",
      "difficulty": "Beginner",
      "choices": [
        "Applies styles when screen width is 768px or less",
        "Applies styles when screen width is exactly 768px",
        "Applies styles when screen width is more than 768px",
        "Only applies to tablets with 768px width"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The 'max-width: 768px' media query applies styles when the viewport width is 768 pixels or smaller. This is commonly used for mobile-first responsive design to apply mobile styles on smaller screens.",
      "industryContext": "Media queries are essential for responsive web design, ensuring websites work well on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops. 768px is a common breakpoint for tablet/mobile design.",

        "<input type=\"text\" validate=\"email\">"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "HTML5 introduced the 'email' input type which automatically validates that the entered text follows email format (contains @ symbol and valid structure). Modern browsers will show validation errors if the format is incorrect.",
      "industryContext": "HTML5 form validation reduces the need for custom JavaScript validation and provides better user experience with instant feedback on form inputs.",
