    ],
    "intro": "Web security is critical for protecting applications and user data from malicious attacks. Understanding security fundamentals helps developers build robust applications that resist common vulnerabilities and protect sensitive information.\n\nIn this lesson, you'll learn about the OWASP Top 10 security risks including injection attacks, broken authentication, sensitive data exposure, and security misconfigurations. These represent the most critical security issues facing web applications today.\n\nAuthentication and authorization form the backbone of application security. You'll understand the difference between these concepts and learn to implement secure login systems, session management, and access controls that protect user accounts and data.\n\nSecure coding practices prevent vulnerabilities at the source. You'll discover input validation techniques, output encoding, secure storage methods, and proper error handling that make applications resilient against attacks.\n\nBy mastering these security fundamentals, you'll be equipped to identify potential vulnerabilities early, implement robust security measures, and follow industry best practices that protect both applications and users from cyber threats.",

      "example": "// Web Security Best Practices Implementation\n\n// 1. Input Validation and Sanitization\nfunction validateAndSanitizeInput(input, type) {\n  // Remove potentially harmful characters\n  const sanitized = input.replace(/<script[^>]*>.*?</script>/gi, '');\n  \n  switch (type) {\n    case 'email':\n      const emailRegex = /^[^\\s@]+@[^\\s@]+\\.[^\\s@]+$/;\n      if (!emailRegex.test(sanitized)) {\n        throw new Error('Invalid email format');\n      }\n      break;\n    \n    case 'username':\n      const usernameRegex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{3,20}$/;\n      if (!usernameRegex.test(sanitized)) {\n        throw new Error('Username must be 3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscore only');\n      }\n      break;\n      \n    case 'password':\n      if (sanitized.length < 8) {\n        throw new Error('Password must be at least 8 characters');\n      }\n      break;\n  }\n  \n  return sanitized;\n}\n\n// 2. Secure Authentication Implementation\nconst bcrypt = require('bcrypt');\nconst jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');\n\nclass AuthService {\n  static async hashPassword(password) {\n    const saltRounds = 12; // Increased for better security\n    return await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds);\n  }\n  \n  static async verifyPassword(password, hashedPassword) {\n    return await bcrypt.compare(password, hashedPassword);\n  }\n  \n  static generateToken(user) {\n    const payload = {\n      userId: user.id,\n      email: user.email,\n      role: user.role\n    };\n    \n    return jwt.sign(payload, process.env.JWT_SECRET, {\n      expiresIn: '15m', // Short-lived tokens\n      issuer: 'your-app-name',\n      audience: 'your-app-users'\n    });\n  }\n  \n  static verifyToken(token) {\n    try {\n      return jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET, {\n        issuer: 'your-app-name',\n        audience: 'your-app-users'\n      });\n    } catch (error) {\n      throw new Error('Invalid or expired token');\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// 3. Authorization Middleware\nfunction authorize(requiredRole) {\n  return (req, res, next) => {\n    try {\n      const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];\n      \n      if (!token) {\n        return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Access token required' });\n      }\n      \n      const decoded = AuthService.verifyToken(token);\n      \n      if (requiredRole && decoded.role !== requiredRole) {\n        return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Insufficient permissions' });\n      }\n      \n      req.user = decoded;\n      next();\n    } catch (error) {\n      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid token' });\n    }\n  };\n}\n\n// 4. SQL Injection Prevention\nconst mysql = require('mysql2/promise');\n\nclass UserRepository {\n  static async findByEmail(email) {\n    // Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection\n    const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ? AND active = 1';\n    const [rows] = await db.execute(query, [email]);\n    return rows[0];\n  }\n  \n  static async createUser(userData) {\n    const query = `\n      INSERT INTO users (email, password_hash, name, role, created_at) \n      VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, NOW())\n    `;\n    \n    const [result] = await db.execute(query, [\n      userData.email,\n      userData.passwordHash,\n      userData.name,\n      userData.role || 'user'\n    ]);\n    \n    return result.insertId;\n  }\n}\n\n// 5. Security Headers Middleware\nfunction securityHeaders(req, res, next) {\n  // Prevent XSS attacks\n  res.setHeader('X-XSS-Protection', '1; mode=block');\n  \n  // Prevent MIME type sniffing\n  res.setHeader('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');\n  \n  // Prevent clickjacking\n  res.setHeader('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY');\n  \n  // HTTPS enforcement\n  res.setHeader('Strict-Transport-Security', 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains');\n  \n  // Content Security Policy\n  res.setHeader('Content-Security-Policy', \n    \"default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';\");\n  \n  next();\n}\n\n// Usage Examples\napp.use(securityHeaders);\napp.post('/api/login', async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    const email = validateAndSanitizeInput(req.body.email, 'email');\n    const password = validateAndSanitizeInput(req.body.password, 'password');\n    \n    const user = await UserRepository.findByEmail(email);\n    \n    if (!user || !await AuthService.verifyPassword(password, user.password_hash)) {\n      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials' });\n    }\n    \n    const token = AuthService.generateToken(user);\n    res.json({ token, user: { id: user.id, email: user.email, role: user.role } });\n  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(400).json({ error: error.message });\n  }\n});\n\napp.get('/api/admin/users', authorize('admin'), (req, res) => {\n  // Only admin users can access this endpoint\n  res.json({ message: 'Admin access granted' });\n});",
