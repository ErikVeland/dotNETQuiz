    ],
    "intro": "Variables are fundamental building blocks in programming that store and manage data in your applications. Understanding data types is crucial for writing efficient and bug-free code.\n\nIn this lesson, you'll learn about primitive data types including numbers, strings, and booleans. We'll explore how different programming languages handle these types and when to use each one effectively.\n\nVariables act as containers that hold values which can change during program execution. Proper variable management is essential for memory efficiency and code readability. You'll discover naming conventions that make your code self-documenting and easier to maintain.\n\nBy the end of this lesson, you'll confidently declare variables, choose appropriate data types, and follow industry-standard naming practices. These skills form the foundation for all programming concepts you'll learn throughout your development journey.\n\nWe'll cover practical examples showing how variables store different types of information, from user input to calculation results. Understanding these fundamentals will prepare you for more complex topics like functions, arrays, and object-oriented programming.",

      "example": "// Variable declarations with different data types\n\n// Numbers (integers and floating-point)\nlet age = 25;\nlet price = 19.99;\nlet temperature = -5;\n\n// Strings (text data)\nlet firstName = \"John\";\nlet lastName = \"Doe\";\nlet message = `Hello, ${firstName} ${lastName}!`;\n\n// Booleans (true/false values)\nlet isLoggedIn = true;\nlet hasPermission = false;\nlet isValidEmail = email.includes('@');\n\n// Constants (values that don't change)\nconst PI = 3.14159;\nconst MAX_USERS = 100;\n\n// Variable naming conventions\nlet userName = \"camelCase for variables\";\nconst API_URL = \"UPPER_CASE for constants\";\nlet is_valid = false; // avoid snake_case in JavaScript\n\nconsole.log(`Age: ${age}, Price: $${price}, User: ${firstName}`);",

They determine which code runs when, based on conditions and repetition needs.\n\nIn this lesson, you'll learn how to make decisions in your code using if statements, else clauses, and complex conditional logic. These structures allow your programs to respond dynamically to different situations and user inputs.\n\nLoops are essential for performing repetitive tasks efficiently. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, you'll use for loops, while loops, and do-while loops to iterate through data and repeat operations.\n\nSwitch statements provide a clean way to handle multiple possible values for a single variable. This is particularly useful when dealing with user choices, menu systems, or processing different types of data.\n\nBy mastering these control structures, you'll be able to create programs that make intelligent decisions and handle repetitive tasks automatically. These concepts are fundamental to all programming languages and essential for building any meaningful application.",
