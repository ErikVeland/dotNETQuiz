    "intro": "HTML5 semantic elements provide meaningful structure to web documents, making them accessible to screen readers and search engines while improving code maintainability.\n\nIn this lesson, you'll learn about semantic elements like header, nav, main, article, section, and footer that replace generic div elements. These elements convey meaning about the content they contain, making your websites more accessible.\n\nProper HTML structure is the foundation of web development. You'll discover how semantic markup improves SEO rankings, helps assistive technologies understand your content, and creates a logical document outline.\n\nHTML5 also introduced new form input types and validation attributes that enhance user experience without requiring JavaScript. You'll learn about email, date, number inputs and built-in validation features.\n\nBy mastering semantic HTML5, you'll create websites that are accessible to all users, rank better in search engines, and provide a solid foundation for CSS styling and JavaScript interactions. This knowledge is essential for modern web development.",

These layout systems are essential for creating professional, responsive designs that work across all devices.\n\nResponsive design ensures your websites look great on smartphones, tablets, and desktops. You'll learn media queries, flexible units, and responsive design patterns that adapt to different screen sizes.\n\nCSS3 also introduces powerful visual effects including transitions, animations, transforms, and advanced selectors. These features help create engaging user experiences without requiring JavaScript.\n\nBy the end of this lesson, you'll confidently create responsive layouts, implement smooth animations, and use modern CSS3 features to build visually appealing websites that work perfectly across all devices and browsers.",
