    "intro": "Performance optimization is crucial for creating successful web applications that provide excellent user experiences. Even small improvements in load times can significantly impact user engagement and business metrics.\n\nIn this lesson, you'll learn about Core Web Vitals - Google's metrics for measuring user experience including Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). These metrics directly affect search rankings and user satisfaction.\n\nBrowser DevTools provide powerful profiling capabilities that help identify performance bottlenecks. You'll master the Performance tab, Network tab, and Lighthouse audits to diagnose issues ranging from slow JavaScript execution to inefficient asset loading.\n\nCommon performance issues include blocking JavaScript, large bundle sizes, inefficient CSS, and poor image optimization. Understanding these patterns helps you proactively design performant applications rather than fixing issues after deployment.\n\nBy the end of this lesson, you'll confidently use profiling tools to measure performance, identify bottlenecks, and understand the relationship between code quality and user experience. This foundation is essential for building fast, responsive web applications.",
