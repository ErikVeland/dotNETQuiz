# Fullstack Academy Migration Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for migrating from the current unified architecture to the new technology-specific module architecture.

## Current State Analysis

### Unified Architecture
The current implementation uses:
- **Frontend**: Single Next.js application for all modules
- **Backend**: Single .NET Core GraphQL API
- **Data**: JSON files stored in the backend
- **Deployment**: Monolithic deployment

### Limitations
1. All modules use the same technology stack regardless of what they teach
2. Limited authentic learning experience
3. Tightly coupled components
4. Difficult to scale individual modules independently

## Target State

### Technology-Specific Architecture
The new implementation will use:
- **Individual Modules**: Each technology implemented with its own stack
- **Gateway**: Nginx reverse proxy for routing
- **Independent Deployment**: Each module deployed separately
- **Shared Design System**: Consistent UI/UX across modules

## Migration Phases
