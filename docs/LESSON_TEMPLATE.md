## Content Quality Standards

### Title Requirements
- **Length**: 10-80 characters
- **Format**: Title Case (e.g., "Advanced Database Indexing Strategies")
- **Clarity**: Must clearly indicate the specific concept being taught
- **Specificity**: Avoid generic terms like "Basics" - be specific about what is being taught

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Entity Framework Code-First Migrations"
- ✅ "React Hooks: useState and useEffect"
- ✅ "CSS Grid Layout Fundamentals"
- ❌ "Introduction to Programming"
- ❌ "Basics"
- ❌ "How to Code"

### Description Requirements
- **Length**: 100-500 characters
- **Structure**: "Learn [objective] and [practical application]. [Context and importance]."
- **Learning Focus**: Must include specific learning objectives
- **Practical Context**: Should explain real-world relevance

**Template Structure:**
```
Learn [specific concept/skill] and [how it applies in practice]. 
[Why this concept is important] and [when developers use it in real projects].
[What students will be able to do after completing this lesson].
```

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Learn how to implement Entity Framework Code-First migrations and manage database schema changes over time. Migrations are essential for team development and production deployments, allowing you to version control your database structure and safely update schemas without data loss."

### Code Example Requirements
- **Executability**: All code must be executable and produce the stated output
- **Length**: Maximum 2000 characters for readability
- **Comments**: Include helpful comments explaining complex logic
- **Best Practices**: Follow industry coding standards and conventions
- **Variable Names**: Use clear, descriptive variable names
- **Error Handling**: Include appropriate error handling where relevant

**Code Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Code executes without errors
- [ ] Variable names are descriptive
- [ ] Comments explain non-obvious logic
- [ ] Follows language conventions
- [ ] Demonstrates best practices
- [ ] Includes realistic example data
- [ ] Shows complete, working examples

### Learning Objectives Standards
- **Count**: 2-3 specific, measurable objectives
- **Format**: Action verb + specific skill + context
- **Measurability**: Each objective should be testable/assessable

**Action Verbs to Use:**
- Create, Build, Implement, Design
- Explain, Describe, Analyze, Compare
- Apply, Use, Utilize, Integrate
- Troubleshoot, Debug, Optimize, Refactor

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Implement Entity Framework migrations to manage database schema changes"
- ✅ "Apply Code-First conventions to automatically generate database tables"
- ✅ "Troubleshoot common migration errors and conflicts"
- ❌ "Understand migrations" (too vague)
- ❌ "Learn about databases" (not specific)

### Real-World Application Standards
- **Length**: 50-200 characters
- **Industry Context**: Explain where/when this is used professionally
- **Practical Value**: Connect learning to career skills
- **Specificity**: Mention specific scenarios or use cases

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Essential for team development environments where multiple developers need to sync database changes, and for production deployments requiring zero-downtime schema updates."
- ✅ "Used in e-commerce applications for managing product catalogs, user authentication systems, and content management platforms."
